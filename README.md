This project was written for HackISU in Spring 2016. It is a front end webpage that incorporates basic and calculated advanced statistics of the top scorers in the NBA. The back end includes the web scraper (written in python), the advanced statistics (written in C++), and the analysis of the data written in ipython. We hope you enjoy our project that we completed in 36 hours (technically 24 hours but it is the same)!
